          <Text>
            This app generates the same time-based one-time codes (TOTP) as Google Authenticator,
            Authy, or 1Password — the six or eight digit codes used for two-factor login. Every
            account is encrypted with AES-256-GCM before it's saved to this browser's IndexedDB,
            under a key derived from a passphrase only you know. Nothing is ever sent to a server;
            the app works fully offline once loaded, and can be installed as an app on your phone
            or desktop.

            Accounts are encrypted with AES-256-GCM under a random 256-bit key (the "Vault Master
            Key"), which is itself encrypted under a key derived from your passphrase via
            PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 at 600,000 iterations. That key is marked non-extractable in the
            browser's Web Crypto API — it cannot be read back out in raw form, even by this app's
            own code.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            Optional device unlock uses WebAuthn's <strong>PRF extension</strong> specifically —
            not just a basic fingerprint prompt — because only PRF actually returns key material
            your browser can encrypt with. If your device doesn't support PRF, the option simply
            won't appear, rather than offering a weaker unlock that only pretends to add
            encryption.

          <Text>
            This protects your accounts if your device storage is accessed directly without your
            passphrase (e.g. a stolen laptop, or another OS user account reading browser files).
            It does <strong>not</strong> protect against malware running on your device while the
            vault is unlocked, a weak/reused passphrase, or phishing — see the full write-up in{' '}
            <code>SECURITY.md</code> in the repository for the complete threat model.

            Your accounts live in this specific browser profile, on this device, for this site's
            origin. A different browser, a different device, clearing site data, or private/
            incognito mode all mean a separate, empty vault. Moving to a new device means either
            restoring a backup, or re-scanning each account's QR code from its issuing service
            (most services can show it again from their own security settings).

        <Section title="FAQ">
          <FaqItem q="I forgot my passphrase — can it be recovered?">
            No. There's no server-side recovery mechanism, by design — anyone who could reset it
            for you would also be someone who could decrypt your accounts. If you have an
            exported backup, restore from that; otherwise you'll need to re-enroll 2FA with each
            service individually.
          </FaqItem>
          <FaqItem q="Does this work without internet?">
            Yes — once loaded (or installed as an app), code generation, adding accounts, and
            backups all work fully offline. It's a PWA specifically designed for this.
          </FaqItem>
          <FaqItem q="Has this been security-audited?">
            No formal third-party audit has been performed. The cryptographic core (TOTP/HOTP math
            and the encryption layer) is unit-tested against official RFC test vectors. See{' '}
            <code>SECURITY.md</code> for exactly what has and hasn't been verified.
          </FaqItem>
          <FaqItem q="Can I use this on two devices?">
            Not with live sync — export a backup from one device and import it on the other. Each
            device keeps its own independent copy after that.
