 * never stored in the clear — only wrapped (encrypted) copies of it are
 * stored, one per unlock method:
 *
 *   - `wrappedVmk`: VMK encrypted under a PBKDF2 key derived from the
 *     passphrase. This also doubles as the passphrase check: if it fails
 *     to decrypt, the passphrase was wrong (AES-GCM's auth tag makes this
 *     safe — no separate canary value is needed).
 *   - `webAuthn.wrappedVmk`: VMK encrypted under a key derived from a
 *     WebAuthn PRF extension output, present only if the user opted in.
 *
 * This means changing the passphrase only requires re-wrapping the VMK
 * (cheap, instant) rather than re-encrypting every account.
